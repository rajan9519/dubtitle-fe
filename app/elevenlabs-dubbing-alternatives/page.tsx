    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Why choose Dubtitle over ElevenLabs for video dubbing projects?",
        answer: "Dubtitle is specifically engineered as a comprehensive ElevenLabs alternative for video creators. While ElevenLabs excels at voice generation, Dubtitle provides an integrated video dubbing ecosystem that combines the same voice quality with video-optimized workflows, transparent pricing, and enterprise-grade project management capabilities designed for professional content production."
      },
      {
        question: "Does Dubtitle match ElevenLabs voice quality standards?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Our platform leverages the same industry-leading voice synthesis technology as ElevenLabs, enhanced with proprietary video optimization algorithms. This ensures you receive the same premium voice quality while benefiting from advanced video-specific features like automated timing synchronization and format optimization that ElevenLabs doesn't provide."
      },
      {
        question: "How does Dubtitle pricing compare to ElevenLabs for video content?",
        answer: "Dubtitle offers significant cost advantages over ElevenLabs for video production. While ElevenLabs uses character-based pricing that can be unpredictable for video content, our transparent minute-based model typically reduces costs by 40-60%. Our video-optimized infrastructure eliminates the additional development and integration costs required when building ElevenLabs-based video workflows."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I migrate my existing ElevenLabs voice profiles to Dubtitle?",
        answer: "Yes, we support seamless migration from ElevenLabs to maintain consistency across your content. Our platform accommodates custom voice profiles and brand-specific audio assets, ensuring your transition from ElevenLabs to Dubtitle preserves your unique voice identity while unlocking superior video production capabilities."
      },
      {
        question: "What technical advantages does Dubtitle offer over ElevenLabs API integration?",
        answer: "Unlike ElevenLabs API implementation which requires significant technical development, Dubtitle provides a complete, ready-to-use video dubbing platform. We eliminate the complexity of custom integration, audio-video synchronization coding, and workflow management that ElevenLabs API users must develop independently. This saves months of development time and ongoing maintenance overhead."
      },
      {
        question: "Which content formats and languages does Dubtitle support compared to ElevenLabs?",
        answer: "Dubtitle supports 29+ languages with the same quality standards as ElevenLabs, plus comprehensive video format compatibility that ElevenLabs lacks. We handle everything from social media content to broadcast-quality productions, with automated optimization for different platforms and resolutions‚Äîcapabilities that require custom development when using ElevenLabs APIs directly."
