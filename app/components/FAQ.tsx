      question: "How accurate is the AI dubbing compared to human voice actors?",
      answer: "Our AI achieves 99.2% accuracy in translation and voice matching. We use advanced neural networks trained on millions of hours of speech data. While human voice actors can vary in quality and consistency, our AI delivers consistent, professional results every time. For most content types, viewers cannot distinguish between our AI dubbing and professional human dubbing."
    },
    {
      question: "What languages do you support?",
      answer: "We support 50+ languages including Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese (Mandarin & Cantonese), Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Arabic, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Polish, Turkish, Greek, Hebrew, Thai, Vietnamese, and many more. We're constantly adding new languages based on user demand."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to dub a video?",
      answer: "Most videos are processed in 2-10 minutes depending on length and complexity. A 10-minute video typically takes 8-12 minutes to complete. This includes translation, voice generation, and lip-sync processing. Compare this to traditional dubbing which takes 2-6 weeks!"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I adjust the voice tone and style?",
      answer: "Absolutely! You have full control over voice characteristics including tone (professional, casual, energetic), speed, accent, and even emotional expression. You can preview different options and make unlimited revisions until it's perfect. We also offer voice cloning to match your original speaker's voice."
    },
    {
      question: "What video formats do you support?",
      answer: "We support all major video formats including MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, MKV, FLV, and more. Maximum file size is 2GB for individual uploads. We automatically optimize your video for the best dubbing results while maintaining original quality."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my content secure and private?",
      answer: "Yes, we take security very seriously. All uploads are encrypted, we're SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and follow enterprise-grade security practices. Your content is never shared or used for training. You can delete your content anytime, and we automatically delete processed files after 30 days."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost?",
      answer: "Our pricing starts at $29 for videos up to 10 minutes, $59 for up to 30 minutes, and $99 for up to 60 minutes. This includes unlimited revisions and downloads. Enterprise plans start at $299/month with volume discounts. No hidden fees, no per-language charges."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I try it before buying?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer a 7-day free trial with no credit card required. You can dub up to 3 videos (max 5 minutes each) to test the quality. We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not completely satisfied."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not satisfied with the results?",
      answer: "We offer unlimited revisions during your project. If you're still not satisfied, we provide a 30-day money-back guarantee. Our success rate is 98%+ customer satisfaction, and our support team will work with you to get the perfect result."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer bulk discounts for multiple videos?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer volume discounts starting at 20% off for 10+ videos per month. Enterprise customers get up to 50% off with annual plans. Contact our sales team for custom pricing if you have large volume needs."
